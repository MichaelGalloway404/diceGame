# Dice Game
School project.  
Create a two-player dice rolling game in Python, but I rewrote it in JavaScript with HTML and CSS to give it a fun visual feel.   
Add some silly effects to choose random colors for the interface every time the dice are rolled.  
  
It is updated now to Simulate real dice logic.  
After a die is cast it will role in a forward, left, or right motion showing the corresponding die face based of its previous face.
